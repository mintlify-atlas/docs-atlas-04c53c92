title: Quick Start
description: Get started with LiveUpdate Tester by subscribing to your first object property and viewing live updates.
---

This guide will walk you through using LiveUpdate Tester to monitor object properties in your Designer project.

## Prerequisites

<Note>
Before starting this guide, make sure you have:
- Designer running on your system
- LiveUpdate Tester plugin installed (see [Installation](/installation))
- A Designer project loaded with at least one object (e.g., a screen or layer)
</Note>

## Understanding the URL Format

LiveUpdate Tester connects to your Designer instance using a URL parameter. The basic format is:

```
http://localhost/?director=<director-address>:<port>
```

<Info>
**Examples:**
- Designer on localhost port 80: `http://localhost/?director=localhost:80`
- Designer on remote machine: `http://localhost/?director=192.168.1.100:80`
- Default (uses current hostname): `http://localhost/`
</Info>

The plugin automatically uses `window.location.hostname` if no `director` parameter is provided, as shown in the initialization code from App.vue:19-20:

```typescript
const queryParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
const director = queryParams.get('director') ?? window.location.hostname;
```

## Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Launch the Plugin">
    Open LiveUpdate Tester from Designer's plugin launcher or navigate to it in your web browser:
    
    ```
    http://localhost/?director=localhost:80
    ```
    
    You should see the main interface with the title "LiveUpdate Subscriptions" and an input field labeled "Object Name".
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Your First Object">
    In the "Object Name" field, enter the path to a Designer object. For example:
    
    ```
    screen2:surface_1
    ```
    
    <Tip>
    The format follows Designer's object hierarchy. Common examples:
    - `screen2:surface_1` - A surface on screen 2
    - `layer1` - A layer object
    - `timeline1:track1` - A track on a timeline
    </Tip>
    
    Click the **Add** button or press **Enter** to add the object.
    
    The interface will display a new subscription box showing:
    - The object name
    - The object type in brackets (e.g., `[Surface]`)
    - A table for property subscriptions
    - An input field to add property subscriptions
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Subscribe to a Property">
    In the property input field within the object's subscription box, enter a property path you want to monitor. For example:
    
    ```
    brightness
    ```
    
    or for nested properties:
    
    ```
    transform.position.x
    ```
    
    <Info>
    The plugin includes autocomplete functionality powered by the Designer Python API. Start typing to see available property suggestions.
    </Info>
    
    Add the property subscription and watch as the "Value" column starts showing live updates from Designer.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Monitor Live Updates">
    As you modify the property in Designer (e.g., adjusting brightness of the surface), you'll see the value update in real-time in the LiveUpdate Tester interface.
    
    The update frequency is configurable. By default, properties are polled at a reasonable interval (as configured in ObjectSubscription.vue:99):
    
    ```typescript
    { updateFrequencyMs: 1000 }
    ```
    
    <Tip>
    You can adjust the update frequency by modifying the subscription options if you need faster or slower updates.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Edit Property Values (Optional)">
    LiveUpdate Tester also allows you to modify property values directly from the UI.
    
    Click the edit action for a property to open a JSON editor. Modify the value and save to push the change to Designer.
    
    <Warning>
    Be careful when editing properties directly, especially on live production systems. Changes are immediately applied to Designer.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding the Interface

### Object Subscription Box

Each added object appears in its own subscription box containing:

- **Object Header**: Shows the object name and type
- **Resource Info**: For Resource objects, displays additional metadata
- **Property Table**: Lists all subscribed properties with their current values
- **Property Input**: Field to add new property subscriptions
- **Remove Button**: Trash icon to remove the entire object subscription

### Property Subscription Row

Each subscribed property displays:

- **Property**: The property path (e.g., `brightness`, `transform.position.x`)
- **Value**: The current live value from Designer
- **Action**: Buttons to edit or unsubscribe from the property

## How LiveUpdate Works

Under the hood, LiveUpdate Tester uses the `@disguise-one/vue-liveupdate` library, which:

1. Connects to Designer via the Python API
2. Subscribes to object properties using Python expressions
3. Polls Designer at the specified frequency
4. Updates Vue reactive refs with new values
5. Triggers UI updates automatically through Vue's reactivity

From App.vue:22, the connection is initialized with:

```typescript
const liveUpdate = useLiveUpdate(director);
```

This creates a LiveUpdate instance that manages all subscriptions and maintains the WebSocket or HTTP connection to Designer.

## Example: Monitoring a Surface

Let's walk through a complete example of monitoring a surface object:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add the Surface Object">
    ```
    screen2:surface_1
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Subscribe to Multiple Properties">
    Add these properties one by one:
    - `brightness`
    - `colour.red`
    - `colour.green`  
    - `colour.blue`
    - `opacity`
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Manipulate in Designer">
    In Designer, select the surface and adjust its brightness, color, and opacity. Watch the values update live in LiveUpdate Tester.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Advanced Features

### Python Expressions

LiveUpdate subscriptions can use Python expressions for computed values. For example, the ObjectSubscription component subscribes to type information using expressions (ObjectSubscription.vue:94-100):

```typescript
const { type, isResource } = props.liveUpdate.subscribe(
  props.objectName, {
    type: 'type(object)',
    isResource: 'isinstance(object, Resource)'
  },
  { updateFrequencyMs: 1000 }
);
```

This retrieves both the object's type and whether it's a Resource object using Python's built-in functions.

### Persistent Subscriptions

LiveUpdate Tester automatically saves your subscriptions to browser localStorage. When you reload the plugin, your objects and property subscriptions are restored automatically.

From SubscriptionManager.vue:34:

```typescript
const objects = useStorage<string[]>('disguise-liveupdate-tester-subscriptionmanager', []);
```

<Tip>
This means you can set up a monitoring dashboard once and it will persist across browser sessions.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin Won't Connect

<Warning>
If the plugin displays a connection error:
1. Verify Designer is running
2. Check the `director` URL parameter is correct
3. Ensure Designer's web service is enabled
4. Try accessing Designer's web interface directly to confirm it's accessible
</Warning>

### Object Not Found

If you get an error when adding an object:
- Verify the object path matches Designer's hierarchy exactly
- Check spelling and capitalization (object names are case-sensitive)
- Ensure the object exists in the current Designer project

### Properties Not Updating

If property values appear frozen:
- Check that Designer is actively running (not paused)
- Verify the property path is correct
- Try unsubscribing and resubscribing to the property
- Check the browser console for error messages
