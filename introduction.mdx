## What is LiveUpdate Tester?

LiveUpdate Tester is a Vue 3 application plugin for disguise Designer that provides a powerful interface for testing and monitoring live updates from the `@disguise-one/vue-liveupdate` library. It allows you to subscribe to object properties in your Designer project and view their changes in real-time.

### What is disguise Designer?

Disguise Designer is a professional media server platform used in live events, broadcast, and virtual production. It manages complex visual workflows, handles real-time rendering, and controls multiple outputs for large-scale productions. Designer exposes objects and properties through its API, which this plugin helps you monitor and test.

### How LiveUpdate Tester Helps

When building custom plugins or integrations with disguise Designer, you need to understand how object properties update in real-time. LiveUpdate Tester provides an intuitive UI to:

- Subscribe to any object in your Designer project
- Monitor property values as they change
- Edit property values directly from the interface
- Test different update frequencies and subscription configurations
- View resource metadata for Designer objects

## Architecture

LiveUpdate Tester is built with:

- **Vue 3**: Modern reactive UI framework
- **@disguise-one/vue-liveupdate**: Core library for subscribing to Designer properties
- **@disguise-one/designer-pythonapi**: Python API integration for Designer
