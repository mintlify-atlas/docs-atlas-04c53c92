description: Learn how to install LiveUpdate Tester as a Designer plugin or set it up for development.
---

There are two ways to use LiveUpdate Tester: install the pre-built plugin for immediate use, or set up the development environment to customize and extend the plugin.

## Plugin Installation (Recommended)

For most users, installing the pre-built plugin is the fastest way to get started.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Download the Plugin">
    Download the latest release from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/disguise-one/Designer_Plugin-Live_Update/releases).
    
    <Tip>
    Look for the latest version in the releases page. The download will be a `.zip` file containing the built plugin.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Locate Your Project's Plugins Folder">
    Find the `plugins` folder in your running Designer project directory. This is typically located in:
    
    ```
    [Your Project Path]/plugins/
    ```
    
    <Note>
    The project must be running in Designer for the plugin to be accessible.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Extract the Plugin">
    Unzip the downloaded plugin archive into the `plugins` folder. The structure should look like:
    
    ```
    plugins/
    └── liveupdate-tester/
        ├── index.html
        ├── assets/
        └── d3plugin.json
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Access the Plugin">
    The plugin will now be available in two ways:
    
    **From Designer:**
    - Open the plugin launcher inside Designer
    - Look for "Live Update tester" in the plugin list
    - Click to launch the plugin
    
    **From Web Browser:**
    - Navigate to `http://localhost/` in your web browser
    - Select "Live Update tester" from the web-based plugin launcher
    
    <Info>
    The plugin requires an active Designer session to function, as specified in the `d3plugin.json` configuration (`requiresSession: true`).
    </Info>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Development Setup

Set up a development environment to modify the plugin or contribute to the project.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Docker" icon="docker">
    [Install Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and ensure it's running on your system.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="VS Code + Dev Containers" icon="code">
    [Install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers).
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
The development environment uses Docker containers to ensure consistent dependencies and configuration. Make sure Docker is running before proceeding.
</Warning>

### Setup Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the Repository">
    Clone the LiveUpdate Tester repository to your local machine:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/disguise-one/Designer_Plugin-Live_Update.git
    cd Designer_Plugin-Live_Update
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Open in VS Code">
    Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code:
    
    ```bash
    code .
    ```
    
    When prompted, click **Reopen in Container**. If you don't see the prompt:
    
    1. Press `F1` to open the command palette
    2. Type `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`
    3. Select the command
    
    <Info>
    VS Code will build the development container. This may take a few minutes the first time.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Start the Development Server">
    Once the container is built and running, open a terminal in VS Code and start the development server:
    
    ```bash
    npm run serve
    ```
    
    The development server will start using Vite, typically on port 5173.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Access the Development Server">
    Open your browser and navigate to:
    
    ```
    http://localhost:5173?director=localhost:80
    ```
    
    This assumes Designer is running on `localhost` at port `80`. Adjust the `director` parameter if your Designer instance is running elsewhere.
    
    <Tip>
    The `director` URL parameter tells the plugin where to find your Designer instance. See the [Quick Start guide](/quickstart) for more details.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Development Workflow

The development server uses Vite for hot module replacement (HMR), which means:

- Changes to Vue components are reflected instantly
- No manual page refresh required
- Fast rebuild times for rapid iteration

<Note>
The project structure includes:
- `src/components`: Vue components for managing subscriptions
- `src/App.vue`: Main application component
- `src/main.ts`: Application entry point
</Note>

## Building for Production

To create a production build of the plugin:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate optimized files in the `dist` folder, ready to be deployed to a Designer project's `plugins` directory.

For creating a release package:

```bash
npm run release
```

This builds the project and runs the release script to create a distributable package.
