description: Learn how to contribute to the LiveUpdate Tester project and set up your development environment
---

This guide will help you set up your development environment and start contributing to the LiveUpdate Tester plugin.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed and running
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension for VS Code

<Info>
The project uses VS Code Dev Containers to provide a consistent development environment with all necessary dependencies pre-configured.
</Info>

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the Repository">
    Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/disguise-one/Designer_Plugin-Live_Update.git
    cd Designer_Plugin-Live_Update
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open in VS Code">
    Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code:

    ```bash
    code .
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Reopen in Container">
    When prompted, click **Reopen in Container**. If you don't see the prompt:

    1. Press `F1` to open the command palette
    2. Type `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`
    3. Select the command

    <Note>
    The container uses the `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/typescript-node:1-22-bookworm` image with Node.js 22 and TypeScript pre-installed.
    </Note>

    The Dev Container will automatically run `npm install` after creation to install all dependencies.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start the Development Server">
    Once the container is built and running, open a terminal in VS Code and start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run serve
    ```

    The development server will start on port 5173.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test in Your Browser">
    Open your browser and navigate to:

    ```
    http://localhost:5173?director=localhost:80
    ```

    <Info>
    This assumes Designer is running on localhost at port 80. Adjust the `director` query parameter if your Designer instance is running on a different host or port.
    </Info>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Development Workflow

### Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **`src/components/`** - Vue components for managing subscriptions:
  - `SubscriptionManager.vue` - Main component for adding/removing object subscriptions
  - `ObjectSubscription.vue` - Displays and manages subscriptions for a single object
  - `PropertySubscription.vue` - Individual property subscription with live value display
  - `PropertyInput.vue` - Input component for adding new property subscriptions
  - `ResourceInfo.vue` - Displays resource-specific information
- **`src/App.vue`** - Main application component
- **`src/main.ts`** - Application entry point
- **`src/liveupdate_tester.py`** - Python module for autocomplete functionality

### Making Changes

<Steps>
  <Step title="Make Your Changes">
    Edit the source files in the `src/` directory. The Vite development server will automatically reload when you save changes.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Your Changes">
    Test your changes in the browser with a running Designer instance. The plugin requires an active Designer session to function properly.

    <Warning>
    The plugin is configured with `"requiresSession": true` in `d3plugin.json`, so it will only work when Designer has an active session.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Build the Plugin">
    Before committing, ensure the plugin builds successfully:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    This will create the production build in the `dist/` directory.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key Libraries

The project uses the following key dependencies:

- **[@disguise-one/vue-liveupdate](https://github.com/disguise-one/vue-liveupdate)** - Core library for LiveUpdate functionality
- **[@disguise-one/designer-pythonapi](https://github.com/disguise-one/designer-pythonapi)** - Python API integration for Designer
- **Vue 3** - Progressive JavaScript framework
- **json-editor-vue** - JSON editor component for property values
- **Vite** - Build tool and development server

## Hot Module Replacement

The development server uses Vite's HMR (Hot Module Replacement) to provide instant feedback:

- Vue component changes are reflected immediately
- The application state is preserved when possible
- Full page reload occurs only when necessary

## Tips for Contributors

<Note>
- The project uses TypeScript for type safety
- Vue Volar extension is pre-configured in the Dev Container for enhanced Vue 3 support
- Use the browser's Developer Tools to debug LiveUpdate connections and subscriptions
- Check the console for Python module registration messages
